<h1> Humans vs.Machines: An AI Odyssey</h1>

<p>by Christopher Watkins</p>

***Breaking News:Alpha Go has won the first two matches!*** In this,the third in our series on the
epic Go matches being played between Alpha Go(Google’s Artificial Intelligences of tware) and
LeeSe-Do l(Current Go World Champion),we look at the history of Humans vs.Machines,and the innovations
that have led us to this incredible moment in time.

For as long as humans have built things, we’v wrestled with the implications of what we’ve built.
In many cases,these philosophical ande thical wrestlings have made
for great drama—think Frankenstein,or 2001: AS pace Odyssey.Often,the hypothetical scenarios
we envision come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve mads <del>going to takeover
the world </del>not such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer. The Triumph Of Deep Blue.

<h2>The Triumph of Deep blue</h2>

<p>
<ins>Perhaps this</ins> is why we so captivated by humans. machine competitions, because the idea of being overcome by that
which we’ve created speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness. 
When IBM’s Deep Blue faced of against Garry Kasparov<sup>1</sup>, the event resulted in more than  
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/de-de/?ar=1" target="_blank"> three billion impressions </a> 
Listings displayed here are auto around the world and when IBM’s later creation Wats on
challenged the champions on Jeopardy, millions of viewers we reglued to the proceedings.

<h2>Deep Mind’s AlphaGo</h2>

<p>
Taking place right now,there is an event that, while not likely to scale the same media heights,may 
in fact have far greater implications when it comes to the future of “intelligent” machines. On 
March 9, in Seoul, South Korea, a computing system know as AlphoGo built by researchers at Deep 
Mind—aGoogle Artificial Intelligence lab) began <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/"
target="_blank">five-game match</a>  against LeeSe-dol, one of the very best players 
in the world at the ancient game of Go.
</p>

<H3>Why is this so significant?</H3>

<p>
Here is how the Deep Mind team explained it in their paper<a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/" 
target="_blank"> the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search: </a> The 
game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence 
due to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. 
Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who strive to create machines 
that can “think” on their own, because success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something 
more than justs kill, knowledge, and experience. It requires intuition. Feel. Style. Characteristics 
we associate with humans, not with machines.
